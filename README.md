# my-vagrant-puppet

My current vagrant + puppet files, work in progress.

Designed to provide a common PHP development enviroment with all the bells and whistles I like to use, such as :

- Ruby
- NodeJS
- Bower
- Composer
- GruntJS
- SaSS
- LESS

and anything else I find useful at the time, included a automatic port forwarder, I use this on my MBP running Mavericks
